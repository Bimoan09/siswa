i am assuming you have installed ubuntu (or any OS you prefer), python 3 and odoo version 14 in your environment, next:

1. clone this repository
2. move folder siswa to **odoo custom addons** in your environment
3. go to odoo -> Settings -> Apps -> Updates -> Updates apps list
4. Search module "siswa"
5. Install module "siswa"
